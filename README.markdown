# NOTICE
This is an early version and I don't expect it to work in all cases.

Currently, the biggest item that I am working on is getting dates extracted correctly.

If you have suggestions or an .adt file that has issues being read then let me know and I might be able to work on it.

# Ruby-ADT

Ruby ADT is a small fast library for reading Advantage Database Server database files (.ADT)

* Project page: <http://github.com/chasemgray/Ruby-ADT>
* Original post: <http://chase.ratchetsoftware.com/2010/02/reading-advantage-database-server-files-adt-in-ruby>
* Report bugs: <http://github.com/chasemgray/Ruby-ADT/issues>
* Questions: Email <mailto:chase@ratchetsoftware.com> and put ADT somewhere in the subject line

## Installation
  
    gem install ruby-adt

This will install activesupport > 2.1, which might install an [unsupported] rails 3 version!  Use the 2.3.x version of activesupport.
  
## Basic Usage

Load an ADT file:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'adt'

    table = ADT::Table.new("test.adt")

Enumerate all records

    table.each do |record|
      puts record.name
      puts record.email
    end
    
Load a single record using <tt>record</tt> or <tt>find</tt>

    table.record(6)
    table.find(6)

Attributes can also be accessed through the attributes hash in original or
underscored form or as an accessor method using the underscored name.

    table.record(4).attributes["PhoneBook"]
    table.record(4).attributes["phone_book"]
    table.record(4).phone_book
  
Search for records using a simple hash format.  Multiple search criteria are
ANDed. Use the block form of find if the resulting recordset could be large
otherwise all records will be loaded into memory.
    
    # find all records with first_name equal to Keith
    table.find(:all, :first_name => 'Keith') do |record|
      puts record.last_name
    end
    
    # find all records with first_name equal to Keith and last_name equal
    # to Morrison
    table.find(:all, :first_name => 'Keith', :last_name => 'Morrison') do |record|
      puts record.last_name
    end
    
    # find the first record with first_name equal to Keith
    table.find :first, :first_name => 'Keith'
    
    # find record number 10
    table.find(10)
  
## Migrating to ActiveRecord

An example of migrating a DBF book table to ActiveRecord using a migration:

    require 'adt'

    class CreateBooks < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def self.up
        table = ADT::Table.new('db/adt/books.adt')
        eval(table.schema)

        table.each do |record|
          Book.create(record.attributes)
        end
      end

      def self.down
        drop_table :books
      end
    end
  
## Limitations and known bugs
  
* ADT is read-only
* External index files are not used
* ActiveSupport 3+ is not supported, use 2.3.x
